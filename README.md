#### This is the open source code for the website #####.com where it creates an easy framework to create and join ping pong leagues. It allows for easy tracking of rankings and progress with skills and stats. 

## Elo Ranking System
#### Our application uses the Elo Ranking system. This is the same system used for Chess. It calculates the probability of each opponent wining and awards points based on that probability.
